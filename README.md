## The Problem

Running Claude Code on 10 projects? OpenCode on 5 more? Another agent somewhere in the background?

**Managing multiple AI sessions gets messy fast.** Too many terminal tabs. Hard to track what's running, what's waiting, what's done. Switching between projects means hunting through windows.

## The Solution

**Agent Deck is mission control for your AI coding agents.**

One terminal. All your agents. Complete visibility.

- 🎯 **See everything at a glance** - Running, waiting, or idle - know the status of every agent instantly
- ⚡ **Switch in milliseconds** - Jump between any session with a single keystroke
- 🔍 **Never lose track** - Search across all conversations, filter by status, find anything in seconds
- 🌳 **Stay organized** - Group sessions by project, client, or experiment with collapsible hierarchies
- 🔌 **Zero config switching** - Built on tmux - sessions persist through disconnects and reboots

## Features

### 🍴 Explore Multiple Solutions in Parallel

**Try different approaches without losing context.** Fork any Claude conversation instantly. Each fork inherits the full conversation history - perfect for comparing solutions or experimenting without risk.

![Fork Session Demo](demos/fork-session.gif)

- Press `f` for quick fork, `F` to customize name/group
- Fork your forks - explore as many branches as you need
- Session IDs auto-detected even after restarts

**Why this matters:** Ever wished you could try two different approaches to the same problem? Now you can. Fork, experiment, compare results, keep what works.

### 🔌 Add Superpowers On-Demand

**Attach MCP servers without touching config files.** Need web search? Browser automation? GitHub integration? Toggle them on per project or globally - Agent Deck handles the restart automatically.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a4af5ba-bacb-4234-ac72-a019d424d593

- Press `M` to open, `Space` to toggle any MCP server
- **LOCAL** scope (just this project) or **GLOBAL** (everywhere)
- Session auto-restarts with new capabilities loaded

**Why this matters:** Stop editing TOML files. Stop remembering restart commands. Just toggle what you need - Agent Deck takes care of the rest.

**Adding Available MCPs:**

Define your MCPs once in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`, then toggle them per project:

```toml
# Web search

### 🧠 MCP Socket Pool (Heavy Users)

**Running 20+ Claude sessions? Each one spawns separate MCP processes.** That's a lot of memory - 30 sessions with 5 MCPs each = 150 node processes eating gigabytes of RAM.

**MCP Socket Pool shares MCP processes across all sessions via Unix sockets.** One memory server. One exa server. One firecrawl server. All sessions share them.

```
Without pool:              With pool:
Session 1 → memory         Session 1 ─┐
Session 2 → memory         Session 2 ─┼─→ memory (shared)
Session 3 → memory         Session 3 ─┘
= 3 processes              = 1 process

Memory savings: 85-90% for MCP processes
```

**Enable in `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:**

```toml
[mcp_pool]
enabled = true     # Enable socket pooling
pool_all = true    # Pool all available MCPs

# Optional: exclude specific MCPs from pool
exclude_mcps = ["chrome-devtools"]
```

When enabled, all MCPs defined in `[mcps.*]` start as socket proxies at launch. Sessions connect via Unix sockets instead of spawning separate processes.

**Indicators:**
- 🔌 in MCP Manager shows pooled MCPs
- Sessions auto-use socket configs on restart

**Why this matters:** If you're a power user running many Claude sessions, this dramatically reduces memory usage. Your laptop stops struggling. Swap stops thrashing. Everything runs smoother.

### 🔍 Find Anything in Seconds

**Fuzzy search across all sessions.** Type a few letters, instantly filter. Need to find that bug fix conversation from last week? The session where you were experimenting with authentication? Just start typing.

Press `/` to search. Filter by status with `!` (running), `@` (waiting), `#` (idle), `$` (error).

**Why this matters:** When you're managing 20+ sessions across different projects, memory fails. Search doesn't.

### 🎯 Know What's Happening, Instantly

**Smart status detection shows you what every agent is doing right now.** No more guessing which session is waiting for input, which is thinking, which finished an hour ago.

| Status | Symbol | What It Means |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Running** | `●` green | Agent is actively working |
| **Waiting** | `◐` yellow | Needs your input |
| **Idle** | `○` gray | Ready for commands |
| **Error** | `✕` red | Something went wrong |

Works with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor, and any terminal tool.

**Why this matters:** Stop checking every session manually. See the full picture at a glance. Respond when needed. Stay in flow.

## Installation

**Works on:** macOS • Linux • Windows (WSL)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the binary, installs tmux if needed, and configures tmux for mouse/clipboard support.

Then run: `agent-deck`

> **Windows:** [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) first.

### Claude Code Skill

If you use Claude Code, install the agent-deck skill for AI-assisted session management:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add asheshgoplani/agent-deck
/plugin install agent-deck@agent-deck
```

This teaches Claude how to create sessions, manage MCPs, fork conversations, and orchestrate sub-agents.

**Spawn sub-agents with individual MCPs:**

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8056955-c147-451a-b2f6-fad34bce8a15

*Two research agents running in parallel - one with Reddit MCP for community insights, another with GitHub MCP for code research. Each agent has its own context and tools.*

## Usage

```bash
agent-deck                    # Launch TUI
agent-deck add .              # Add current directory as session
agent-deck add . -c claude    # Add with Claude Code
agent-deck list               # List all sessions
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j/k` or `↑/↓` | Navigate |
| `Enter` | Attach to session |
| `n` | New session |

## CLI Commands

Agent Deck provides a full CLI for automation and scripting. All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output and `-p, --profile` for profile selection.

> **Note:** Flags must come BEFORE positional arguments (Go flag package standard).

### Quick Reference

```bash
agent-deck                              # Launch TUI
agent-deck add . -c claude              # Add session with Claude
agent-deck list --json                  # List sessions as JSON
agent-deck status                       # Quick status overview
agent-deck session attach my-project    # Attach to session
```

### Session Commands

Manage individual sessions. Sessions can be identified by:
- **Title**: `my-project` (exact or partial match)
- **ID prefix**: `a1b2c3` (first 6+ chars)
- **Path**: `/Users/me/project`

```bash
# Start/Stop/Restart
agent-deck session start <id>           # Start session's tmux process
agent-deck session stop <id>            # Stop/kill session process
agent-deck session restart <id>         # Restart (Claude: reloads MCPs)

# Fork (Claude only)
agent-deck session fork <id>            # Fork with inherited context
agent-deck session fork <id> -t "exploration"       # Custom title
agent-deck session fork <id> -g "experiments"       # Into specific group

# Attach/Show
agent-deck session attach <id>          # Attach interactively
agent-deck session show <id>            # Show session details
agent-deck session show                 # Auto-detect current session (in tmux)
agent-deck session current              # Auto-detect current session and profile
agent-deck session current -q           # Just session name (for scripting)
agent-deck session current --json       # JSON output (for automation)
```

**Fork flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-t, --title` | Custom title for forked session |
| `-g, --group` | Target group for forked session |

### MCP Commands

Manage Model Context Protocol servers for Claude sessions.

```bash
# List available MCPs (from config.toml)
agent-deck mcp list
agent-deck mcp list --json

# Show attached MCPs for a session
agent-deck mcp attached <id>
agent-deck mcp attached                 # Auto-detect current session

# Attach/Detach MCPs
agent-deck mcp attach <id> github       # Attach to LOCAL scope
agent-deck mcp attach <id> exa --global # Attach to GLOBAL scope
agent-deck mcp attach <id> memory --restart  # Attach and restart session

agent-deck mcp detach <id> github       # Detach from LOCAL
agent-deck mcp detach <id> exa --global # Detach from GLOBAL
```

**MCP flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--global` | Apply to global Claude config (all projects) |
| `--restart` | Restart session after change (loads new MCPs) |

### Group Commands

Organize sessions into hierarchical groups.

```bash
# List groups
agent-deck group list
agent-deck group list --json

# Create groups
agent-deck group create work            # Create root group
agent-deck group create frontend --parent work  # Create subgroup

# Delete groups
agent-deck group delete old-projects    # Delete (fails if has sessions)
agent-deck group delete old-projects --force    # Move sessions to default, then delete

# Move sessions
agent-deck group move my-session work   # Move session to group
```

**Group flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--parent` | Parent group for creating subgroups |
| `--force` | Force delete by moving sessions to default group |

### Status Command

Quick status check without launching the TUI.

```bash
agent-deck status                       # Compact: "2 waiting - 5 running - 3 idle"
agent-deck status -v                    # Verbose: detailed list by status
agent-deck status -q                    # Quiet: just waiting count (for prompts)
agent-deck status --json                # JSON output
```

### Global Flags

These flags work with all commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON (for automation) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Minimal output, rely on exit codes |
| `-p, --profile <name>` | Use specific profile |

### Examples

**Scripting with JSON output:**
```bash
# Get all running sessions
agent-deck list --json | jq '.[] | select(.status == "running")'

# Count waiting sessions
agent-deck status -q  # Returns just the number

# Check if specific session exists
agent-deck session show my-project --json 2>/dev/null && echo "exists"
```

**Automation workflows:**
```bash
# Start all sessions in a group
agent-deck list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.group == "work") | .id' | \
  xargs -I{} agent-deck session start {}

# Attach MCP to all Claude sessions
agent-deck list --json | jq -r '.[] | select(.tool == "claude") | .id' | \
  xargs -I{} agent-deck mcp attach {} memory --restart
```

**Current session detection (inside tmux):**
```bash
# Auto-detect current session and profile (NEW!)
agent-deck session current              # Full info with auto-detected profile
agent-deck session current -q           # Just session name (for scripting)
agent-deck session current --json       # JSON output (for automation)

# Show current session info (legacy, still works)
agent-deck session show

# Show MCPs for current session
agent-deck mcp attached

# Use in workflows (auto-detect parent and profile)
PARENT=$(agent-deck session current -q)
PROFILE=$(agent-deck session current --json | jq -r '.profile')
agent-deck -p "$PROFILE" add -t "Subtask" --parent "$PARENT" -c claude /tmp/subtask
```

## Updates

Agent-deck checks for updates automatically and notifies you when a new version is available.

### Update Notification

When you open the TUI, a yellow banner appears if an update is available:
```
⬆ Update available: v0.8.1 → v0.8.2 (run: agent-deck update)
```

CLI commands (`list`, `status`) also show a notification:
```
💡 Update available: v0.8.1 → v0.8.2 (run: agent-deck update)
```

### Update Commands

```bash
agent-deck update              # Check and install update
agent-deck update --check      # Just check, don't install
agent-deck update --force      # Force check (bypass 24h cache)
```

### Configuration

Add to `~/.agent-deck/config.toml`:

```toml
[updates]
# Automatically install updates without prompting (default: false)
auto_update = true

# Enable update checks on startup (default: true)
check_enabled = true

# How often to check for updates in hours (default: 24)
check_interval_hours = 24

# Show update notification in CLI commands (default: true)
notify_in_cli = true
```

### Auto-Update

When `auto_update = true`, agent-deck will:
1. Check for updates on startup
2. Automatically download and install if available
3. Exit so you can restart with the new version

## FAQ

### How is this different from just using tmux?

Agent Deck adds **AI-specific intelligence** on top of tmux:
- **Smart status detection** - Knows when Claude is thinking vs. waiting for input (not just "session exists")
- **Session forking** - Duplicate Claude conversations with full context inheritance
- **MCP manager** - Visual interface for attaching/detaching Model Context Protocol servers
- **Global search** - Find conversations across all sessions instantly
- **Organized groups** - Hierarchical project organization instead of flat session lists

Think of it as **tmux + AI awareness**. The sessions run in tmux (reliability), but Agent Deck adds the layer that understands what AI agents are doing.

### Does it work with tools besides Claude Code?

**Yes!** Agent Deck works with any terminal-based tool:
- ✅ **Claude Code** - Full integration (session detection, MCP management, fork, resume)
- ✅ **Gemini CLI** - Full integration (session detection, MCP management, resume)
  - Session detection from `~/.gemini/tmp/<project-hash>/chats/`
  - Resume with `gemini --resume <id>`
  - MCP management via UI (press `M`)
  - Response extraction via `session output`
  - **Note:** No fork support (use sub-sessions instead)
- ✅ OpenCode
- ✅ Cursor (terminal mode)
- ✅ Codex
- ✅ Custom shell scripts
- ✅ Any command-line tool

Claude and Gemini get full integration with session management, MCP configuration, and response extraction. Other tools get status detection, organization, and search.

### Can I use it on Windows?

**Yes, via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).**

1. [Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Ubuntu recommended)
2. Open WSL terminal
3. Run the installer: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asheshgoplani/agent-deck/main/install.sh | bash`

Agent Deck runs inside WSL and works exactly like it does on macOS/Linux.

### Will it interfere with my existing tmux setup?

**No.** Agent Deck creates its own tmux sessions with the prefix `agentdeck_*`. Your existing sessions are untouched.

The installer adds optional tmux config (mouse support, clipboard integration) but:
- It backs up your existing `~/.tmux.conf` first
- You can skip it with `--skip-tmux-config` flag
- It only adds to your config, never removes

### How do I add more MCP servers?

Edit `~/.agent-deck/config.toml` and add your servers:

**Stdio MCPs** (local command-line tools):
```toml
[mcps.your-server]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "your-mcp-package"]
env = { API_KEY = "your-key" }
description = "What this server does"
```

**HTTP/SSE MCPs** (remote servers):
```toml
[mcps.remote-api]
url = "https://mcp.example.com/mcp"
transport = "http"  # or "sse"
description = "Remote MCP server"
```

Then press `M` in Agent Deck to toggle it on/off for any session. [See MCP examples](#adding-available-mcps).

### Why is Agent Deck using so much memory?

If you're running many Claude sessions (10+), each spawns its own MCP processes. This adds up fast.

**Enable MCP Socket Pool** to share processes across sessions:

```toml
# ~/.agent-deck/config.toml
[mcp_pool]
enabled = true
pool_all = true
```

Restart Agent Deck. All sessions now share MCP processes via Unix sockets. Memory usage drops 85-90% for MCP-related processes.

### What if a session crashes?

tmux sessions persist even if Agent Deck closes. If a session crashes:

1. **Check logs**: `~/.agent-deck/logs/agentdeck_<session-name>_<id>.log`
2. **Restart it**: `agent-deck session restart <session-id>`
3. **Or delete and recreate**: `agent-deck remove <id>` then `agent-deck add <path>`

Sessions are stored in `~/.agent-deck/profiles/default/sessions.json` with automatic backups (`.bak`, `.bak.1`, `.bak.2`).
